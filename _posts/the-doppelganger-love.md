title: The Doppelganger Love
---

In the depths of my soul, a mirrored heart beats
A twin to mine, a doppelganger, a duplicate
With every breath I take, it takes one too
Our love is entwined, like two halves of an apple

Together we dance, in perfect harmony
Our steps in unison, as if by fate
Our hearts beat as one, a single rhythm
In each other's eyes, our love will forever last

But alas, our love is forbidden
A crime against nature, a violation of the norm
For two such as us, to love so deeply
Is a sin, a taboo, that cannot be ignored

So we keep our love hidden away
A secret only known to us, night and day
But even in silence, it echoes loud and clear
A love so pure, so true, that cannot be fear'd
