title: The Legendary Dragon's Wish
---

In the land of magic and might,
A dragon lay hidden from sight.
With scales of gold and eyes so bright,
He guarded a secret deep inside.

The dragon's name was Ember true,
And those who sought him, few did pursue.
For only those with pure hearts could find,
The dragon's lair, hidden from mankind.

In the cave where Ember lay,
Lay a glowing egg, his magic swayed.
A wish, one single wish, he granted fast,
To those who proved their worth, at last.

For in the land of magic and might,
Ember's legacy lived on through night.
And though his fire may fade with time,
His legend lived on, forever in rhyme.
