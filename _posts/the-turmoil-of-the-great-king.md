title: The Turmoil of the Great King
---

In the halls of power, he ruled with grace
A leader of men, in his place
But as time passed, the cracks began to show
And the great king's reign was soon to go

With every decision, a price was paid
As his people suffered, his reign decayed
The once-great kingdom, now in disarray
Was torn apart by the turmoil he'd made

But still he ruled, with an iron hand
Despite the chaos, he stood grand
For he believed his way was the only one
And all else was but a foolish fun

But as the years went by, and the kingdom fell
The great king's reign was laid to rest in hell
And though he ruled with power and might
He was brought low by the turmoil of the night
