title: A Midsummer Night's Dream
---

Under starry skies, we dance and play,
With fairies, sprites, and woodland creatures gay.
The moon shines bright, casting spells of delight,
As we bask in the magic of this midsummer night.

Rustic lanes and forests deep and wide,
Where love and laughter never need to hide.
The sweetest dreams are born of summer's glow,
And in this enchanted land, our hearts do flow.

So let us revel in this fleeting spell,
Of midsummer night, when love is at its swell.
For as the seasons turn and fade to sleep,
This magical time will forever keep.
