title: Seeding Hope to the Next Generation
---

In the garden of life, we sow a seed,
A future full of promise, for you and me.
With every passing day, it grows and flourishes,
A symbol of hope, for all generations to cherish.

We plant the seeds of love and kindness too,
And nurture them with care, as they grow anew.
For in this world, where darkness sometimes reigns,
Our actions shape the future, with gentle rains.

So let us tend the garden with devotion,
And watch it bloom with joyful emotion.
For in the next generation, we see our fate,
And hope for a brighter tomorrow, for all to debate.
