title: The Ancient Civilisation
---

In days of old, a world so grand
Where cultures thrived, hand in hand
From Egypt's pyramids to Greece's fame
The ancient civilisations left their claim to name

Their legacies live on, a testament to time
A treasure trove of knowledge, forever aligned
With gods and goddesses, myths and rhyme
Their stories woven, in a tapestry of prime

From the Acropolis to the Great Wall
Each civilisation left its mark, standing tall
A testament to their ingenuity and might
A heritage that shines, through day and night

Let us cherish these legacies, let us preserve
For in them lies, a world of endless service
To inspire and educate, for generations to come
The ancient civilisations, forever won.
