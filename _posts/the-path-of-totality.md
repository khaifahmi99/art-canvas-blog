title: The Path of Totality
---

The sun hides behind a veil of clouds,
A shadow creeps across the land,
A path of totality, where all is still,
As nature's show unfolds at command.

The moon moves in tandem with the earth,
A celestial dance of ancient lore,
Blocking out the sun's bright light and birth,
Leaving only darkness to explore.

The path of totality, a rare sight to see,
A moment frozen in time eternity,
Where stars and planets align in harmony,
In this fleeting display of glee.

So gather 'round and marvel at the show,
As night descends and day does go,
For in this path of totality, we know,
The universe's secrets do unfold.
