title: Resistance Behind the Shadow
---

In the depths of night, where shadows play,
A resistance stirs, beyond the fray.
A force that defies, a will unbroken,
A determination to resist, unspoken.

Behind the shadows, secrets lie,
A struggle for control, where souls do fly.
The resistance fights, with heart and might,
To break free from the darkness of night.

With every step, a challenge stands,
A test of strength, in endless hands.
The resistance rallies, with hope anew,
To find the light, and see it through.

In the depths of night, where shadows reign,
The resistance fights on, to break the chain.
With every breath, a dream unfolds,
Of freedom found, and darkness told.
