title: Cycle of Despair and Hope
---

In the cycle of life, we're bound to face
Despair and hopelessness, a heavy weight
That presses down upon our shoulders, drains
Our energy and will, leaving us in disarray

But hope is like a flame that flickers bright
A beacon in the dark, a guiding light
It shines within our souls, a ray of grace
A promise of tomorrow, a brighter place

So let us hold on tight to hope's embrace
And face each day with courage in its place
For in the cycle of life, we find the strength
To rise above despair and reach new heights

With every fall, we rise again anew
A cycle of despair and hope, we break through
And though the road may be long and hard
We'll find our way to a brighter day in the yard.
