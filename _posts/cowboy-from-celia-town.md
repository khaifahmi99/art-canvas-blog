title: Cowboy from Celia Town
---

In the dusty streets of Celia Town,
A lone cowboy roams with a heavy frown.
His spurs jingle as he walks with a slow pace,
The weight of his past upon his face.

With eyes that have seen the endless skies,
And a heart that's known the darkest surmise,
He rides through the town, unnoticed and alone,
A stranger in a world that's not his own.

His guitar slung over his shoulder, he sings,
Of love and loss, of life's cruel stings.
The words flow like a river, pure and free,
As he shares his stories with the breeze.

In Celia Town, where the sun sets low,
The cowboy finds solace in his song.
For in the melody, he finds his peace,
A refuge from the world's ceaseless release.
