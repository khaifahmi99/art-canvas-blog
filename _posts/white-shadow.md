A whispered grace, a wafting form,
Ethereal and pale as the dawn's first light.
A gentle glow that dances on the ground,
Illuminating all, yet shrouded in delight.

The white shadow moves with stealthy grace,
A phantom presence, a fleeting trace.
It flits and darts, a wondrous sight,
A delicate beauty, pure and bright.

In the soft morning light, it appears,
A vision of loveliness beyond all fears.
The white shadow dance, a gentle breeze,
A magical performance, pure and easy.
