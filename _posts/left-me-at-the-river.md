title: left me at the river
---

The river's edge, a place to part
Our love, now lost in the heart
You left me there, without a word
Leaving me with only tears and hurt

The water's flow, a constant stream
Echoes of my sorrow, a never-ending dream
I stand here, alone and blue
Wishing I could turn back time, to be with you
