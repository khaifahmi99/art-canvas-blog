title: The Unknown in the Deepest Ocean
---

Deep in the depths, where light can't reach,
Lies a world of wonder, beyond our grasp.
The unknown in the deepest ocean,
A realm of secrets, unexplored and vast.

Creatures lurk and spirits roam,
In the darkness, where no man has been.
The sea monsters reign supreme,
In the depths of the ocean's mystery.

The tides of time wash over the shore,
Erasing all trace of what we were.
The ocean's heart beats slow and strong,
Keeping secrets that will never be gone.

In the deepest ocean, where no light can shine,
Lies a world of wonder, beyond our design.
