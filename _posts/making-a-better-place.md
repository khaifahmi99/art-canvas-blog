title: Making a Better Place
---

A world where love is the guiding light,
Where kindness reigns and hope takes flight.
A place of refuge for those who've known pain,
Where joy and peace are always sustained again.

With every act of compassion, we make it real,
A haven where hearts can heal and souls feel.
Through unity and empathy, we break the chains,
Of suffering and despair that leave scars in vain.

So let us strive to build this better place,
Where all can find solace and a smile on their face.
With every step, we take towards the light,
We make the world a brighter sight.
