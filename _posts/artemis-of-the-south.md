title: Artemis of the South

Oh, Artemis of the South, so bright in the sky
A beacon of light for those who dare to try
To reach for the stars and touch the face of the sun
For you are the goddess of the heavens, the one

Your rays illuminate the night, a guiding light
For all who seek to explore the cosmic sight
Through your beauty, we see the vastness of space
And the endless possibilities that lie in each embrace

So let us honor you, dear Artemis of the South
With our hearts and minds, we'll make our own path
For with your guidance, we know we can achieve
Anything we set out to, and more than we believe.
