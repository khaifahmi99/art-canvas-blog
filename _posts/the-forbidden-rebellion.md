title: The Forbidden Rebellion
---

Rebels in the night, they rose up strong
Against the forces that sought to keep them wrong
Their cries of freedom, echoed through the land
As they fought against the grip of a tyrant's hand

With swords and spears, they marched onwards bold
Determined to shatter the chains that held
Their spirits unbroken, their hearts untamed
They faced the armies of their oppressors, unflinching

But the odds were stacked against them, great and high
And though they fought with courage, they could not fly
Their bodies broken, their souls half-dead
Yet still they rose, to fight once more ahead

For in their hearts, a fire burned so bright
A flame of hope, that would not take flight
They knew their struggle, was not in vain
And though they lost much, their spirit remained
