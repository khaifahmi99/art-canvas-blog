title: Crossing Horizon
---

Across the vast horizon, we wander free
With every step, a new tale to see
From sunrise to sunset, our spirits soar
As we journey through lands that we've never known before

The world is wide, and we are small but bold
Exploring new lands, where stories unfold
Through mountains high and valleys low
Our hearts fill with wonder, as we go

In foreign fields, we find our home
With every step, a new story to know
The world may be vast, but we're not alone
For in each place, we find a piece of our own
