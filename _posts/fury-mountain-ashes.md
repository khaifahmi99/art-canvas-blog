title: Fury Mountain Ashes
---

The mountain ash, a fierce delight
A sight to behold in the morning light
Its peaks soar high, a rugged spire
A challenge to climbers, a wondrous fire

Within its depths, a story unfolds
Of ancient secrets, and tales untold
The mountain whispers of days gone by
And the fury that has long since passed by

Its slopes are steep, its valleys wide
A land of contrasts, where the elements reside
From the roaring river, to the stillness of the air
The mountain's mood is hard to bear

Yet in its fury, there's a beauty found
A raw power that speaks of nature profound
For those who dare to climb its heights
Will find their spirits lifted, and souls ignited.
