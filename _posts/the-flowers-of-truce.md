title: The Flowers of Truce
---

In gardens of serenity, where love resides,
The flowers of truce bloom with gentle stride.
With petals of purest white and hues of gold,
They symbolize peace, their message to unfold.

In times of strife and discord's reign,
These flowers stand as beacons of hope in vain.
Their beauty is a balm for souls afire,
A reminder that love will forever conspire.

So let us cherish these flowers of peace,
And cultivate them with gentle release.
For in their sweet embrace we find our strength,
And the truce they represent, our hearts can length.
