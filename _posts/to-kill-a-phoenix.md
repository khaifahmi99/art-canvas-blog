title: To Kill a Phoenix
---

In the realm of myths, where tales are spun,
Of creatures born from fire, and lives undone.
The phoenix, a being of wonder, born,
From flames that flicker, like embers sworn.

With feathers bright, like golden hue,
And eyes that shine, like stars in blue.
It rises from ashes, anew each year,
A symbol of hope, and a spirit clear.
But alas, its life is short-lived,
For death looms near, like a shadow's strive.

The phoenix lives but a single day,
And when it dies, a new dawn will play.
Its ashes scattered, in the wind,
A cycle of life, eternal and divine.
So let us cherish this fleeting sight,
For the phoenix's beauty is a pure delight.
