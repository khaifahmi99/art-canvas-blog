title: Monochrome Rainbow
---

A monochrome rainbow in the sky,
A sight to behold, so vibrant and nigh.
The colors blend, a symphony of hue,
A kaleidoscope of beauty, pure and true.

From red to orange, yellow to green,
Each shade a harmony, a color scene.
The sky is painted, with brushes of light,
A masterpiece, a wondrous sight.

The rainbow stretches, from horizon to horizon,
A celestial wonder, a treasure trove of emotion.
It brings us joy, it brings us peace,
A symbol of hope, a release.

So let us marvel at this natural sight,
And bask in the beauty of the monochrome rainbow's light.
