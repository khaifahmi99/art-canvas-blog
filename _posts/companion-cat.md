---

My dearest feline friend, so soft and sweet,
Bringing joy and comfort to my feet.
Your purrs and cuddles are a treat,
A constant source of happiness and delight.

You curl up by the window, basking in the light,
While I write or work through the night.
Your gentle eyes watch over me with care,
A loyal companion, always there.

With your playful antics and mischievous grin,
You steal my heart away, my dear little sin.
I'm grateful for your presence in my life,
My dear companion cat, a true delight.
