title: The Collapse of Rome
---

In the once-great empire, crumbling walls stand tall,
A testament to power that has lost its charm.
From glory to dust, the fate of Rome was sealed,
As nations rose and fell in a world unfurled.

The legions marched, the senate ruled,
But beneath the surface, cracks began to unfold.
Economic strife and political chagrin,
Brought down the giants that once held sway within.

From fire to sword, plague to pestilence,
Rome felt the weight of fate's insistence.
The end was near, a slow and painful decline,
As the once-mighty empire lost its shine.

Yet still we marvel at what once was,
A civilization that spanned the known vastness.
Of Rome, the heart of Europe's birthplace,
Where art and architecture did find their space.

And though she fell, her legacy endures,
A reminder of what humanity can achieve with cures.
For in the ruins of old, we see the grace,
Of a civilization that once held the human race.
