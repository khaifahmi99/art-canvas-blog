title: The Ash of Phoenix
---

In the ashes of a phoenix born,
A new beginning, a chance to morn.
From the flames of passion and desire,
A rebirth, a time for aspire.

The ash may be cold and grey,
But in it, life finds a way.
To bloom anew, to soar on high,
In the embrace of eternal sky.

For in the ashes, we find peace,
A chance to release our ceaseless ease.
From the weight that once did bind,
A liberation, a soul to find.

So let us embrace the ash with grace,
And find the beauty in its place.
For in its depths, we'll find the key,
To rise anew, and set our spirit free.
