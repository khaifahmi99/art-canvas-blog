title: A Midsummer Night's Dream
---

In a forest, dark and deep,
Where fairies dance and flowers sleep,
A midsummer night's dream unfolds,
With love and magic as its gold.

The moon shines bright with gentle light,
As Oberon and Titania fight,
Their kingdoms at stake, their hearts alight,
In this enchanted realm of endless sight.

Puck and Bottom dance with glee,
Adon and Hermia entwined in ecstasy,
Lysander and Demetrius, each one seeks to be,
With love and magic, the victor in this fairy land.

So let us revel in this night so bright,
With love and magic as our guiding light,
And may our dreams be filled with wonder and delight,
In this enchanted realm where all is right.
