title: Beyond Reach
---

In the depths of my soul, a sorrow resides
A longing for what's lost, and cannot be hide
The memories linger, like shadows in mind
Echoes of laughter, now reduced to a find

Grief has taken hold, it's hard to define
The pain that pierces, like a knife in my spine
Yearning for what once was, now beyond reach
A longing so fierce, it's hard to preach

In this darkness, I search for the light
A beacon of hope, to guide me through the night
But alas, it eludes me, like a mirage in the sand
Leaving me lost, in this endless expanse

So I hold on to memories, they're all I have left
A bittersweet reminder, of what I've been bereft
But even those begin to fade, like autumn leaves from a tree
And I'm left with nothing, but the emptiness of misery
