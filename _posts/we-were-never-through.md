title: We Were Never Through
---

In the depths of my heart, you're still there
A memory that I can't help but share
The way we used to be, so in love and so bright
But now it's just a distant light

We were never through, no matter what they say
Our love will always find its way
Through the laughter and the tears, the ups and downs
Our bond will forever be found

Even though we're apart, you're still on my mind
A constant reminder of the love we left behind
I know that someday we'll find our way back to each other
And our love will flourish like a tender budder
