title: Father's Love
---

Dad's gentle touch, a guiding light
A shelter from the world's cold sight
A love so strong, it knows no bounds
A comfort that never fades away

His arms open wide, a safe place to hide
A heart full of kindness, a love inside
He whispers "I'm here, don't you cry"
A father's love, shining bright and high
