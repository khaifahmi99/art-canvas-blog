title: Finding Myself Again
---

In the depths of my soul, I search for me
A voice that's lost, a part of me
Through trials and tribulations, I've found
The courage to unearth, my heart resounds

Like an old map, worn and torn
Leading me to places unknown
I've followed the path, through mountains high
And valleys low, where I have flown

In the stillness of night, I hear a call
A gentle whisper, beyond them all
It beckons me onward, through the storm
To find myself again, my heart form

With every step, I take in stride
I'm one step closer, to my inner pride
A journey within, where I uncover
The truth that sets me free, forever
