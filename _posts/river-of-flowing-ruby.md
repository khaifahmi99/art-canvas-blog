title: River of Flowing Ruby
---

A river of flowing ruby, so serene and so bright
Glistening in the sunlight, with a gentle might
It winds its way through valleys, and over mountains high
Bringing life to all it touches, with a graceful sigh

Its banks are lined with greenery, and flowers bloom in sight
Creating a canvas of colors, both vibrant and bright
The river's voice is soft, a gentle humming sound
As it flows to the sea, its journey never ending, profound

It carries memories of days gone by, and dreams yet to be found
A symbol of life's journey, with a beauty all its own
So let us cherish this river, and all that it holds true
For in its flowing waters, we find the beauty of life anew.
