title: The Clear Lake Under the Moonlight
---

The clear lake under the moonlight glows,
A reflection of the night's soft hue.
The stars above, they twinkle and wander,
As the breeze whispers secrets, new and true.

The water's edge, a place to sit and ponder,
The world's mysteries, and the secrets of the ocean.
The moon's gentle light, it casts a spell,
On the lake's surface, where dreams are born and dwell.

The night is peaceful, and the world is still,
As the lake's embrace, my soul does fill.
In this moment, I am free and clear,
Under the moonlight, my spirit does hear.
