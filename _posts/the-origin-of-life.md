title: The Origin of Life
---

In the depths of time, a tale to tell
Of life's humble birth, and how it fell
From stars and dust, a story old
Of how our world was formed, young and bold

A cosmic dance of atoms wild
Where elements combined, to trial and mild
With water, earth, and fire in tow
Life's building blocks, for all to know

A spark of life, a miracle so grand
In some primordial soup, on this land
From simple cells to complex forms
The journey of life, from swirling storms

And as we search the heavens above
For answers to the questions we love
We find our place in space and time
A cosmic dance, where all are divine
