title: Corruptions Affecting the Next Generation
---

The corrupt ways of old, they linger still
Tainting the youth with their wicked will
Looters and thieves, they leave their mark
On the innocent, a stain that will leave its scar

Generations born into this mess we've made
Must face the consequences, their future unmade
The rot of corruption, it seeps deep inside
Leaving scars that will never subside

But hope remains, a beacon in the night
A chance to turn things right, to make things bright
The next generation, they must take the lead
To rid the world of corruption's deadly creed
