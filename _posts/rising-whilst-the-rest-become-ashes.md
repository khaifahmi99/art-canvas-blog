title: Rising Whilst the Rest Become Ashes
---

The world around us crumbles, decay
Ashes of dreams and hope, left to slumber
Yet in the midst of ruin, we rise anew
Determined to find solace in our shoes

We pick ourselves up, brush off the dust
And start anew, with hearts full of lust
For though the world may be shrouded in pain
Our spirit remains unbroken, like a refrain

We find strength in each other's embrace
And together we rise, to a better place
Where love and hope reign supreme once more
And our dreams are nurtured, forevermore
