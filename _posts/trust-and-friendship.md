title: Trust and Friendship
---

True friends are like trees,
Their love and support never cease.
In good times and bad, they're always there,
A constant source of comfort and care.

Just as roots run deep and strong,
So does the bond between friends long.
Through laughter and tears, they stand by your side,
A trusted ally in life's journey.

Like branches that stretch up high,
Friendships grow and reach new heights.
With each passing day, they bloom and flourish,
A beautiful sight to behold and cherish.

So here's to trust and friendship true,
A bond that only grows stronger as the years go by.
May our hearts always be filled with love and light,
And may our friendships forever take flight.
