Oh, North Star, steadfast and true,
Guiding sailors through the endless blue.
Your light shines bright, a beacon of hope,
A constant in the vastness of scope.

Through stormy skies and rough sea days,
You stand tall, unwavering in your ways.
A source of comfort for those at sea,
A symbol of perseverance, you see.

Your position in the heavens above,
A constant reminder of what we love.
The stars that twinkle with a gentle grace,
A celestial beauty, beyond a race.

So here's to you, dear North Star,
A shining light, near or far.
May your radiance forever guide,
And bring us safely to our side.
