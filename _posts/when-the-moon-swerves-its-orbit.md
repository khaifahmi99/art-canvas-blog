title: When the Moon Swerves Its Orbit
---

When the moon swerves its orbit, a gentle pull
From Earth's embrace, it begins to stray and drift.
A celestial ballet, in slow motion we view,
As the satellite of love, our hearts begin to shift.

The tides respond, in a dance so fine,
As oceans rise and fall, in harmony divine.
The earth's crust trembles, with every step it takes,
A gentle reminder, of nature's cosmic making.

In this eternal waltz, we find our place,
Between the sun and moon, a celestial embrace.
For in their love, we find our own, so true,
A bond that endures, as the universe renews.
