title: Defiance Against the Messiah
---

The masses gather, voices raised in disdain
Against the one they claim is their Savior in vain
They see through the lies, the tricks and the guile
And refuse to bow down to his will

With defiance in their hearts, they stand tall and proud
Refusing to be silenced by the crowd
For they know that true power lies not in the hands of a few
But in the collective strength of those who see through the myths

So let them shout their protests loud and clear
For in their defiance, they show they have no fear
Of the Messiah or his followers, they stand firm and strong
And their voices will be heard, echoing long after the song is gone
