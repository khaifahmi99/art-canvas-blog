title: Resolutions and Taking Risks
---

As we bid adieu to the old,
And welcome in the new,
We make our resolutions with glee,
To turn our lives anew.

With every step we take,
We risk a little more,
But it's in these moments we find our strength,
And soar into tomorrow's hours.

So let us embrace the unknown,
And dance with reckless abandon,
For in each risk we take,
Lies the potential for a brand new story.
