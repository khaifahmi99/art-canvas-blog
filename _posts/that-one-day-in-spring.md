title: That One Day in Spring
---

The sun shone bright, without a cloud in sight
As nature awakened from her wintery night
The trees regained their vibrant hue
And flowers bloomed, their colors anew

A gentle breeze did stir the air
With whispers of change, beyond compare
The world awoke, refreshed and new
In that one day in spring, all was anew
