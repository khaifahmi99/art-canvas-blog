title: Resentment's Flame
---

Resentment flames never dies,
A fire that burns deep inside.
Embers of anger, ashes of pain,
Fueling a passion that never subsides.

With each breath, the flame grows stronger,
As memories of hurt linger on.
The bitterness of past wrongs,
Etched in the soul, forever young.

Resentment's embrace is tight,
A heavy burden to bear at night.
Visions of vengeance dance in the mind,
As the flame of resentment takes its toll on the heart and soul.

But still we carry the weight,
For in our hearts, a fire burns bright and bold.
The flame of resentment, never quenched,
A constant reminder of what we've been robbed.
