title: The Burnt Down Library
---

A hollowed-out shell of what once was grand,
The library stands, a charred land.
Where knowledge spilled like wildfire, now dries,
In the void century, it vanishes.

The books, they melted like snow in sun,
Their pages curled, their words undone.
The silence echoes through the space,
As if the stories never found their place.

A once-great hall of learning and delight,
Now crumbles to the ground, a dire sight.
The ashes of the past, they swirl and dance,
In the void century, a mournful trance.
