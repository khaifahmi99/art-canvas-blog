title: Ancient Secrets at Machu Picchu
---

In the Andean mountains, where the air is crisp and clean
Lies the ancient civilisation of Machu Picchu, serene
A place of mystery, where secrets are revealed in time
Of a people who lived and thrived, with a culture so divine

The Incas built this city, with stones that seem to defy
The laws of gravity, and the will of the sky above
They carved their gods and goddesses, with intricate artistry
And left behind a legacy, that would last for all eternity

In the Sacred Valley, where the land is fertile and bright
Lies the history of Machu Picchu, shining like a beacon in flight
A testament to the ingenuity, of a people so bold
Who left behind a legacy, that would never grow old

The Incas knew the secrets, of the land they called home
And built their civilisation, with a love that was shown
In every stone and every brick, they poured their hearts and souls
And in Machu Picchu, we find the ancient secrets, that they hold.
