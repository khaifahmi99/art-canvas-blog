title: The Reversible Geyser
---

In the heart of the earth, a geyser did flow
With water that seemed to reverse its flow
It heated the ground, and the rocks did glow
A wondrous sight, as the geyser did show

Its steam rose high, into the sky so bright
Reaching for the heavens, with a force so tight
The earth below, did feel its might
As the geyser's power, did ignite

With a roar and a hiss, it began to speak
Its voice echoed through, the mountain's shake
A message of change, a call to the brave
To witness the wonder, of this natural wave

So come and see, this marvel of earth
The reversible geyser, with its wondrous birth
