title: The Wrath of Odin
---

Odin, the king of Asgard's realm,
With power and wisdom, he doth reign supreme.
But when his temper flares and his rage does grow,
Fearful are those who cross his path, you know.

His eye is piercing, his beard flows bright,
And thunder rolls as he takes flight.
Wielding his spear, he doth strike with might,
Leaving foes in ruin, without a fight.

His wolves, they howl, and his ravens caw,
As he unleashes his wrath, oh what a sight to draw!
The gods tremble, the giants quake,
For Odin's ire, no one can escape.

So tread with care, when you venture near,
For the wrath of Odin, is not something to fear.
