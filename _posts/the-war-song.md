title: The War Song
---

Blazing skies, a haze of smoke
The scent of blood, a world awake
Guns blazing, men fall to the ground
A war that rages, with no end found

The cries of innocents, a painful sound
Children orphaned, cities burned down
Fear and hate, they spread like fire
Leaving scars that never subside

But still we fight, for what is right
For freedom and peace, in the dead of night
We stand united, hand in hand
A hope for tomorrow, a brighter land
