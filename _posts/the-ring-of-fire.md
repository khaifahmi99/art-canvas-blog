---

In the depths of Earth's fiery heart,
A circle of fire doth never depart.
From the tropics to the icy pole,
The Ring of Fire doth unfold.

Volcanoes roar and spew their might,
As magma flows with fury bright.
Eruptions shake the earth below,
And ash doth fall in a fiery flow.

The Ring of Fire doth hold sway,
A force of nature in its way.
From earthquakes to wildfires, too,
It doth wreak havoc as it moves anew.

Yet in its destruction, there's grace,
For life doth flourish in its place.
The Ring of Fire doth shape the land,
And all that lives within its hand.
