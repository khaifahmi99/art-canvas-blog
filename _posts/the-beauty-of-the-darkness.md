title: The Beauty of the Darkness
---

In the depths of the night, where shadows play
A world of wonder, in a different way
The stars up above, they twinkle and gleam
As the darkness hides secrets, that only reveal themselves in dreams

The moon, a silver crescent in the sky
Casts a gentle light, on the world as it dies
The trees sway gently, in the night's embrace
As the darkness envelops, in a tender, velvet grace

In this hour of peace, where all is still
The beauty of the darkness, begins to fulfill
A time for rest, and quiet contemplation
Where the soul can soar, without any frustration

So let us bask, in the night's sweet embrace
And allow ourselves, to find grace
For in the darkness, there's beauty to behold
A world of wonder, that only the night can unfold.
