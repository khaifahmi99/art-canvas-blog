---

In the land of the midnight sun,
Where ice and snow meet fun,
There's a dessert that's sweet and fine,
A treat for the taste buds to find.

Dessert of Alaska, oh so divine,
A frozen delight that's truly fine.
Ice cream and yogurt, a perfect pair,
Together they create a culinary flair.

Churned with love and care, you see,
This dessert is fit for royalty.
A mix of flavors, both sweet and tart,
Will leave you wanting more from the start.

So come and try this frozen treat,
In Alaska, where the magic meets.
You'll be glad you did, that's for sure,
When you taste this dessert, pure and pure!
