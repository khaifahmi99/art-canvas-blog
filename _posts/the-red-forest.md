In the red forest, where trees stand tall
A world of wonder, beyond them all
The leaves rustle, as wind whispers by
As creatures roam, in this mystical sky

A canopy of red, above our head
Reflecting light, like a fiery thread
The earthy scent, of this place we find
Fills us with peace, and leaves us blind

In the red forest, where magic dwells
We find solace, in its gentle bells
A sanctuary, for all to share
Where love and joy, are always there.
