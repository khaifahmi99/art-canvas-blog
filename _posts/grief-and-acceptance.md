title: Grief and Acceptance
---

Grief is a journey we all must take,
A path that's fraught with sorrow and woe.
Losing someone dear, it cuts deep inside,
Leaving scars that may never fully heal.

But as the days go by, and the pain subsides,
We find a way to accept what we've lost.
It's not easy, nor is it quick,
But with time, the hurt will start to melt away.

The memories remain, but they're no longer raw,
And though the pain will always linger,
We learn to live with it, and find a way to move on.

For in the end, it's not just about the past,
But finding peace and moving forward at last.
