title: Something I Will Never Say
---

I'll never say goodbye,
For that would mean the end of our time,
And I cannot bear to let you go,
For you are my world, my shining light.

I'll never tell a lie,
For honesty is what I adore,
And I will always speak the truth,
Even if it hurts me more.

I'll never give up hope,
For that is what keeps me strong,
And I will always hold on tight,
To the love that we share all along.

So let us cherish every moment,
And never let our love fade away,
For I will love you until my last breath,
And in death, I'll find my way.
