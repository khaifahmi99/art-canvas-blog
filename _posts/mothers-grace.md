Her gentle touch, a guiding light
A shelter from the world's cold sight
A soft embrace, a warm embrace
A love that endures through time and space

She holds my hand, through joy and pain
A constant presence, always in vain
Her grace, a beacon in the night
Guiding me to do what is right

In her eyes, I see a love so true
A reflection of the love she has for you
A love that's unwavering and strong
A love that will last until the end of time

So here I'll stay, in her gentle embrace
Forever grateful, in this sacred space
For the love and grace she gives each day
Is a gift that I can never repay.
