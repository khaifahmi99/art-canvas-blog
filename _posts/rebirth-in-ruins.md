In fields of blood-red poppies sway,
Where once did bloom the gentle bay.
The scent of lavender fills the air,
But with the stench of death does linger there.

War's destruction brings no peace,
Only death and sorrow do release.
The flowers of love, now trampled down,
By boots that marched upon their crown.

Yet still they bloom, a beacon bright,
A symbol of hope in endless fight.
For though the world may be torn apart,
The beauty of nature will forever start.

In every field where death did reign,
The flowers of peace will rise again.
And though the scars of war may remain,
The flowers of love will bloom once more, to sustain.
