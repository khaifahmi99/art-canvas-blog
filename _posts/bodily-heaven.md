In bodily heaven, we find peace,
A release from earthly grief.
Our mortal coils are shed like worn-out clothes,
And in their place, a radiant light proceeds.

We soar on wings of light and love,
Above the petty cares of earth below.
No more the weight of sorrow's load,
But freedom from all earthly birth.

In this divine abode, we find
A joy that never fades or dwindles.
No tears or sighs distract our view,
For in this realm, all is new.

So let us embrace this wondrous sight,
And revel in the beauty of the light.
In bodily heaven, we are free at last,
To dance and sing with joy untold and vast.
