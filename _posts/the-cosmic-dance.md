title: The Cosmic Dance
---

In the vast expanse of space and time,
A cosmic dance unfolds, divine.
Stars and planets spin, a wondrous rhyme,
As galaxies collide, in endless design.

The universe, a canvas grand,
Echoes with the beat of a celestial band.
From the birth of stars to their eventual demise,
A cosmic ballet, in constant surprise.

In this dance, we find our place,
A fleeting moment in the universe's embrace.
Yet, amidst the vast expanse and time,
Our footprints leave a lasting rhyme.

So let us cherish this cosmic play,
And join the dance, night and day.
For in the beauty of the universe we find,
A reflection of our own cosmic design.
