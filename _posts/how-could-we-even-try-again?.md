title: How Could We Even Try Again?
---

Love left us shattered on the ground
Like a broken mirror, lost and profound
The pieces of our hearts, scattered wide
A love so true, but now it's hard to hide

We tried to mend what once was whole
But like a fragile vase, it could not hold
The cracks ran deep, the break was real
And though we loved, we couldn't conceal

How could we even try again?
With scars that still remain?
Memories of love and laughter shared
But now, they only bring us sorrow and fear?

Perhaps it's time to let go
And move on with our lives, don't you know?
To find a love that's new and true
And give ourselves the chance to be with you.
