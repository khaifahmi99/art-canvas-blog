title: The End of an Empire
---

The sun sets slow and red,
On the ruins of a dream,
An empire crumbles to its deathbed,
From glory to mere scheme.

Once mighty walls stood tall,
Now they lie in dust and ash,
The echoes of great halls,
Are all that remain of the past.

A people rise, new born,
To take the empire's place,
With hope and courage, they'll be forged,
In the fire of time and space.

The end of an empire brings,
A chance for change and light,
A fresh start in the making,
For a brighter future in sight.
