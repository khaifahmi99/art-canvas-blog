title: The Underground Glacier
---

Deep beneath the earth's surface, hidden from sight,
A frozen world of ice and snow takes flight.
The underground glacier, a secrets keep,
Holding tales of climate change, and what it means to seek.

Its walls are made of ice, so strong and steep,
A testament to nature's endless sleep.
The glacier moves with grace, a slow embrace,
As it carves its path, through the earth's vast space.

The melting ice, a warning cry,
A sign of change, before our eyes.
The underground glacier, a symbol true,
Of the impact we, and nature, must pursue.
So let us act with haste, to slow its pace,
And save our planet, before it's too late.
