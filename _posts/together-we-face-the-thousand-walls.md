title: Together We Face the Thousand Walls
---

We stand united, hand in hand,
Facing challenges as they arise,
Together we'll take on the grand plan,
And rise above the thousand walls that divide.

With every step we take, we find our strength,
In the bonds of love and common cause,
We'll break through the barriers of time and space,
And reach the other side with grace.

For in the face of adversity, we'll stand as one,
And show the world what we're made of, done,
Through trials and tribulations, we'll find our way,
And rise above the thousand walls that hold us back each day.
