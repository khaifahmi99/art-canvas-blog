title: Lost in the Deepest Trench
---

In the depths of the ocean so blue
Lost in the trench, where the darkness does brew
The pressure's immense, the silence is true
As I float here, lost in this watery hue

The trench stretches far and wide
A vast expanse, where life does reside
Creatures lurk and creatures roam
In this underwater realm, where no land does know

I'm trapped in this endless sea
Adrift in the currents, lost in misery
The darkness closes in, like a shroud
As I succumb to the depths, my heart does cloud

But still, I hold on to hope
A glimmer of light, that guides me to cope
For in this darkest hour, I find my strength
And in the depths, I'll find my way to length.
