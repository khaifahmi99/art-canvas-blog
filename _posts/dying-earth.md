title: Dying Earth
---

The earth coughs up smoke and fire,
A dying breath, a final sigh.
The oceans churn with rage and pain,
As the planet suffers, humanity's stain.

The forests fade, the wildlife flees,
As the climate changes, our future pleas.
The ice melts, the seas rise high,
As we stand by, and watch the sky.

The wind howls, the storms abate,
As the earth dies, a global fate.
The sun sets, on a world of shame,
As we face the end, in a haze of blame.

But still we dream, of a better day,
When the earth will heal, and live again.
Until then, let us act, to save the way,
For our children's sake, for tomorrow's gain.
