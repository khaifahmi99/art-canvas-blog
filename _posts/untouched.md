In the depths of nature's embrace,
I find solace from life's mad race.
The trees sway gently in the breeze,
As I wander through this peaceful ease.
No footsteps echo through the woods,
Nor any voice that might impose.
I am alone, yet not forlorn,
In this untouched Eden, where I'm born.

The sun shines bright, the birds sing sweet,
A symphony that can't be beat.
I breathe in deep, and let it fill,
This sacred space, where love is still.
No worry, no fear, no heartache here,
Just serenity, and peace that's clear.
In this untouched place, I find my rest,
And let my soul be blessed.
