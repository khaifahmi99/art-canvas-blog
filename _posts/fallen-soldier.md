title: Fallen Soldier
---

A life cut short, a soul departed
In the midst of battle, forever lost
A hero fallen, a nation mourns
Their sacrifice, we'll never forget

The sound of guns, the scent of smoke
Echoes of war, a heartbreak stroke
The memories linger, they never fade
Of the soldier who fought and was slain

In the fields of gold, they lie so still
Their dreams and hopes, forever chill
Their families weep, their loved ones mourn
For the fallen hero, forever torn

Let us remember, let us never forget
The sacrifices made, for our freedom got
May their souls rest in peace, may they be blessed
Forever in our hearts, their memories persist.
