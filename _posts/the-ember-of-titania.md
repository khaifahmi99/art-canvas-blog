title: The Ember of Titania
---

In the realm of Titania's fairy land,
Where magic flows like a river's hand,
An ember glows with fierce delight,
A spark of wonder in the moon's bright light.

It flickers bright, a burning flame,
A symbol of the dreamer's aim,
To ignite the passion that lies deep,
And bring the magic to life's sweet sleep.

Within its glow, a tale unfolds,
Of wonder, joy, and magic told,
Where fairies dance and revel in delight,
In the ember of Titania's fairy light.
