title: The Ancient Dragons
---

In days of old, when legends roamed,
The dragons ruled the land with a fierce brood.
Their scales glimmered like gold in the sun,
And their fierce eyes flashed, like fun.

With wings outspread, they soared on high,
Ruling over realms with an iron hand.
No mortal dared to cross their path,
Lest they face the dragons' wrath.

But as time passed, the dragons fade,
Into myth and legend, where they reside.
Yet still, in the hearts of men,
Their spirit lives on, like a gen.
