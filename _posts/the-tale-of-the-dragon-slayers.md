title: The Tale of the Dragon Slayers
---

In days of yore, when dragons roamed free,
A group of brave warriors didst come to be.
Their deeds of valor, their courage so bright,
Echoed through the ages, a tale of might.

With swords and shields, they fought the beasts,
And brought them down, with triumphant feats.
Their glory spread far and wide,
As they saved the land from dragon's ride.

These dragon slayers, heroes of old,
Their names etched in history's scroll.
Their tale lives on, a legend true,
Of bravery, honor, and courage anew.
