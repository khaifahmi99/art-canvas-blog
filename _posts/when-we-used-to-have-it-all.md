title: When We Used to Have It All
---

In the days of old, when life was new,
We had it all, and we knew just what to do.
The world was bright, the future looked grand,
And hope was alive in every hand.

We dreamed of fame, of fortune too,
Of love that would last, and memories true.
But now the world has changed, and we're left with nothing new,
Just memories of what we had, and what could have been, if only.

The years have passed, and we've grown old,
Our youthful dreams, now but a story told.
We've seen it all, from highs to lows,
And though our hearts still beat, our souls are worn.

But even in the twilight of our days,
We cherish memories, and the love that never fades away.
For though we had it all, and lost it too,
The love we shared, will always see us through.
