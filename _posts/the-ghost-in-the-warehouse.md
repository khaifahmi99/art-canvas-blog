title: The Ghost in the Warehouse
---

Amidst the shelves of old, a form takes flight
Ethereal eyes glimmering bright
The warehouse alive with whispers and moans
As if the dead roam through its bones

In the darkest corners, a presence dwells
Where dusty crates and machinery knell
Footsteps echo, a heavy heartbeat
As if a spirit's soul is freed

In this forsaken place of old things past
The ghost roams on, unseen at last
Its tale a mystery, forever told
Within the walls that now grow cold
