title: The Butterfly and the Rainbow
---

A butterfly flutters by,
A splash of color in the sky.
Its wings a kaleidoscope of hues,
A sight to make the heart anew.

The rainbow stretches far and wide,
A promise of hope, a bridge to cross.
Its colors bright, its beauty inside,
A treasure for the soul to boss.

Together they dance, a wondrous sight,
A symphony of light, a pure delight.
The butterfly and rainbow, friends so true,
A beauty that forever shines through.
