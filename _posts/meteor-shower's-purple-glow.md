title: Meteor Shower's Purple Glow
---

In the night sky, a spectacle unfolds
A meteor shower, its beauty untold
Purple hues dance across the horizon
As cosmic dust burns in the atmosphere

The stars align, a gentle glow
A celestial display, oh so slow
The earth's orbit, a gravitational pull
As meteors streak, their journey full

In this moment, we find our place
Within the vastness of space and time
A reminder of nature's grace
A meteor shower's purple rhyme.
