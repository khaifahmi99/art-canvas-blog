title: The Honeypot at the End of the Rainbow
---

In the land of dreams, where colors blend and shine,
A sweet surprise awaits, for eyes divine.
A honeypot, glistening bright and bold,
At the end of the rainbow, stories untold.

Its lid adorned with flowers, sweet as can be,
 Inviting all to come and see.
The treats inside, a taste of pure delight,
A feast for eyes and mouth, a wondrous sight.

So follow the rainbow, with heart full of cheer,
And find this honeypot, without any fear.
For in its embrace, you'll find your heart's desire,
A treat that will make your soul on fire.
