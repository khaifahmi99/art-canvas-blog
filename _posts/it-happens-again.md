title: It Happens Again
---

In the depths of my mind, a memory resides,
A moment lost, but still it hides,
Behind the veil of time's slow flight,
Where shadows dance, and darkness takes flight.

The scent of roses, the taste of rain,
Echoes of laughter, whispers of pain,
All lingering still, like a fleeting dream,
Slipping away, as the minutes seem.

I reach for it, but it eludes my grasp,
A mirage that fades with each caress,
The memories I hold so dear, so close,
Yet slipping away, like grains of sand in the ocean's flow.

But still I cling, to these fleeting moments,
For in them, my heart finds its sweetest treasures,
And though they fade, like the petals of a flower,
They bloom anew, in the garden of my soul, forever and ever.
