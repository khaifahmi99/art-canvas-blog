title: Dreaming of the Moon
---

Oh, how I dream of the moon tonight
A beacon in the dark of night
It shines so bright and full of light
Guiding me through the endless night

Its gentle glow upon my face
Brings peace to this troubled place
As I gaze up at its silvery light
My worries take flight

The moon, a symbol of hope and grace
A reminder of life's endless race
Guiding us through life's darkest night
To the morning's gentle light
