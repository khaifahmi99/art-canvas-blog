title: The Beautiful But Untouchable Rainbow
---

A spectacle in the sky so bright,
A sight to behold, a wondrous sight.
The rainbow's arc of colors, pure and bold,
A beauty that can never be touched or told.

Its reds and oranges dance before our eyes,
A kaleidoscope of hues that never dies.
Yellow and green, a gentle embrace,
A smile upon the sky's sweet face.

Oh, rainbow, how you fill our hearts with cheer,
A symbol of hope, a promise so clear.
Your colors blend in perfect harmony,
A beauty that can never be tainted by folly.

So let us marvel at your ethereal grace,
And bask in the magic of your radiant face.
