title: When the Fire Dies
---

When the fire dies, the embers fade away
Memories of warmth and light, now just a sway
The flames that once danced, with graceful ease
Are but a distant dream, a fading breeze

The sparks that flew, like stars in the night
Are extinguished now, with nary a fight
The glowing coals, that once did shine
Are reduced to ash, and left behind

And though the fire may be gone, its trace
Lingers on, like a lingering embrace
For in our hearts, it's still alive
A memory of love, that will never die
