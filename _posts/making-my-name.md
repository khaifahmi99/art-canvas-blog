title: Making My Name
---

My name is a work of art,
A masterpiece in the making.
With every stroke of the pen,
I create a new identity.

A fusion of words and sound,
A symphony of letters found.
Together they form a tune,
That echoes through time, so fine.

Ink flows like a river wide,
As I write my name with pride.
Each letter a part of me,
A reflection of who I'll be.

With every line and curve,
I shape my identity, endure.
For in the act of creating,
Lies the power to invent and inventing.
