title: Winter's Fragile Beauty
---

In winter's chill embrace,
The flowers bloom with grace,
A delicate beauty, rare and fleeting,
That nature's hand can spare.

With petals soft and white as snow,
They dance in frosty light,
Their sweet fragrance filling the air,
As winter's icy grip takes hold.

Though winter's fury may prevail,
The flowers thrive with gentle grace,
A testament to nature's might,
And the beauty that it can embrace.
