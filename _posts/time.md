In the blink of an eye, the world spun fast
Moments piled up like a stack of vast
Everything occurred at once, it seemed to me
A kaleidoscope of time, for all to see

The sun rose high in the sky so bright
As the stars twinkled with a gentle might
The wind whispered secrets through the trees
And the earth trembled with a symphony

Time, oh time, you're a mystery so grand
A force that shapes our lives in this land
You move us forward, never to reverse
A journey through moments, forever to improve
