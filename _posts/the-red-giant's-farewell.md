title: The Red Giant's Farewell
---

A behemoth once bright, now waning fast,
The red giant's light begins to fade at last.
Its fiery core, a dying ember now,
As it succumbs to time and nature's law.

Its vast expanse, a burning blaze of old,
Now shrinks to naught but memories so cold.
The cosmos weep, as this celestial queen,
Bids farewell to life, in endless dream.

Yet, in death, a new life springs anew,
As stars are born from the red giant's shoe.
A cycle old, yet always fresh and bright,
In cosmic dance, eternal night.
