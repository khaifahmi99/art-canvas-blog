title: Fossils and History
---

Deep in the earth's ancient heart,
Lies a tale of life from the start.
Fossils hold secrets of days gone by,
A history of life on this earthly sky.

From dinosaurs to ancient sea kings,
These remnants tell stories of their rings.
Of forests and oceans now no more,
But memories forever etched in stone's core.

Time and nature, they conspired to keep,
These traces of life through the ages did creep.
In sedimentary layers, so fine and so deep,
Lies a record of life's great evolutionary leap.

From ammonites to trilobites, they all have their place,
In the grand tale of life on this sacred space.
Fossils are windows to the past, we see,
A history of life in all its glee.
