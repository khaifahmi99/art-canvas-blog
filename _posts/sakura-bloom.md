```
The sakura blooms, a sight to see,
A flurry of pink and white, so delicate.
In springtime's gentle breeze, they dance with glee,
A fleeting beauty, for all to see.

Their petals softly fall, like snowflakes in the sky,
A reminder of life's fragile passing by.
With each bloom, a new tale unfolds,
Of love and life, in seasons old.

So let us marvel at nature's grace,
And bask in beauty's fleeting embrace.
For in the sakura's delicate form,
We find solace from life's harshest storm.
