title: Stitching the Broken Pieces
---

Broken wings, once so free
Now trapped in sorrow's sea
Their beauty lost, their grace degenerate
As shards of hope are scattered far and late

But still they dream, and still they strive
To mend the cracks that time has survived
With every beat, a new attempt to thrive
And heal the wounds that life has left alive

So let us join in this repair
With hands of love and hearts on fire
For every piece, no matter how torn or tattered
Can be made whole once more, and forever be sheltered.
