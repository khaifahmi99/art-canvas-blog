title: Tulips Blooming
---

Tulips blooming, oh so bright,
Colors of the rainbow, a wondrous sight.
Petals of pink and red, yellow and white,
Nature's beauty, a true delight.

They sway in the breeze, a gentle dance,
A symbol of love, a chance to prance.
In gardens they bloom, a beautiful sight,
Bringing joy to all, with their radiant light.

So let us cherish these flowers of spring,
And bask in their beauty, while the world is singing.
For in their delicate petals, we see,
A reflection of life, wild and free.
