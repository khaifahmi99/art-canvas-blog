title: The Changing Landscape
---

The landscape changes with each passing day,
A reflection of the world's evolutionary sway.
From mountains high to valleys low,
Nature's beauty constantly does flow.

Rivers once roamed free and wild,
Now confined to channels, still they smile.
The trees once tall and green and strong,
Now wither, as the seasons move along.

Yet in this change, there's something new,
A beauty born from life anew.
The landscape evolves, it's true,
But so does life, for me and you.
