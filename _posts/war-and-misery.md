title: War and Misery
---

In the depths of war, we find our fate,
Where death and destruction are our destiny.
The screams of innocents, a haunting refrain,
As hope is lost in the chaos that remains.

Bodies piled high, like refuse on the ground,
The stench of blood and sweat, a foul profound.
The cries of children, once full of glee,
Now silenced forever, by the brutal decree.

In this hellhole, where life has no meaning,
We fight for scraps, while death is always leaning.
The weight of war, a burden we can't bear,
As misery and pain, our souls do share.
