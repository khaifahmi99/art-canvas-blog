title: Sailing in the Sky
---

Soaring high above the ground,
The sailboat glides with gentle sound.
Across the horizon it does roam,
A wake of blue behind it goes.

The wind takes hold of its sails,
And carries it to distant jails.
Where sunsets paint the evening sky,
And dreams are made to fly.

In this celestial sea,
The sailboat finds its destiny.
A journey without end or fear,
Through the heavens it does steer.
