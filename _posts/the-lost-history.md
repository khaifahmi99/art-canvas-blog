title: The Lost History
---

In the depths of time, a tale unfolds
Of civilizations, lost in the cold
Their stories, forgotten, left to decay
As the sands of history slipped away

In ancient lands, where empires stood tall
Libraries bled, their knowledge to enthrall
The pages yellowed, the words now gone
Leaving only whispers of what was shown

Secrets hidden, in dusty halls
Tales untold, for ages and calls
The echoes of the past, still linger
In the shadows, where memories cling

And so we search, through lands unseen
For answers to questions left unanswered
The lost history, a mystery to be gleaned
A treasure trove, for eyes to be read
