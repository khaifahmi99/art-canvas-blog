title: Motives and Behaviour
---

Hidden depths, a maze we navigate
With every step, a choice we make
Our motives, like shadows in the night
Guiding us, but often out of sight

We act on impulse, or so it seems
But beneath the surface, complex dreams
Of happiness and fulfillment we seek
Yet sometimes our actions lead to wreck

The drive for power, a force so strong
Can lead us down a dangerous path long
And when we're blinded by ambition's light
We forget what truly matters in life's fight

But love and kindness, these we hold dear
And though they may not bring immediate cheer
Their beauty shines like a beacon in the night
Guiding us towards a brighter sight
