title: The Toba Supervolcano's Fury
---

A burst of fury from beneath the earth,
A force so great it threatened man's worth.
The Toba supervolcano, a sight to see,
Wrath unleashed upon humanity.

In Indonesia's heart, it lay in wait,
Beneath the surface, a sleeping fate.
But oh, how it stirred and roared,
As the earth shook with a mighty force.

A cloud of ash and smoke did spread,
Blinding the sun, with a poisoned breath.
The winds did carry, far and wide,
A deadly fog that brought man to his side.

The supervolcano's wrath was great,
A challenge to the human race.
Survival hung in the balance, a fate,
As nature's fury left its mark.

But still we persevered, through the strife,
And found a way to endure the life.
For though the Toba supervolcano brought,
Death and destruction, it also taught.

A lesson in resilience, we did learn,
To face the unknown, and never fear.
The power of nature, so great and true,
Shall always be there, to see us through.
