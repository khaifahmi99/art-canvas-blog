title: Tyranny and Slavery
---

In chains we toil, our rights denied,
Our voices silenced, our souls enslaved.
The tyrant rules with iron hand,
While we suffer, lost in a strange land.

No freedom do we know, no hope in sight,
Just endless toil, day and night.
Our dreams are crushed, our hearts oppressed,
As tyranny and slavery persist.

But still we resist, we fight for rights,
For freedom's light, for justice in the night.
With every breath, with every heartbeat,
We strive for liberty, for what is just and neat.

So let us rise, let us take a stand,
Against the chains that bind our land.
Together we can break the yoke of fear,
And bring forth hope, and banish all despair.
