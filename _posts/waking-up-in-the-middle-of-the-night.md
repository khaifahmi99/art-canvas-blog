title: Waking Up In The Middle Of The Night
---

I wake up in the dead of night
My mind racing, can't slow down
Thoughts tumble out like a stormy fight
As I lie here, unable to drown

The darkness presses in on me
A heavy weight that I can't breathe
I try to calm myself, but it won't be free
This restlessness that plagues me, you see

I toss and turn, my body aches
As if the night is trying to break me
But still I fight, through all the pains
For sleep is what I truly crave

And so I lie here, waiting for the dawn
Hoping that tomorrow will bring a new morn
When I'll be able to rest and be reborn
