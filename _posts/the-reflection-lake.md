title: The Reflection Lake
---

On the still waters, a mirrored sky appears,
A reflection of the heavens, so clear and so near.
The trees along the shore, they sway with the breeze,
As the sun casts its rays upon the peaceful sea.

The water's edge, a place to rest and unwind,
Where nature's symphony, can be found in kind.
The ripples of the lake, they dance and they play,
On this serene and peaceful day.

So let us bask in the beauty of this sight,
And let our spirits soar with delight.
For in the reflection of the lake's embrace,
We find solace and peace, in this sacred space.
