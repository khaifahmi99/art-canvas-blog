title: Forever in My Heart
---

My dearest furry friend, so dear to me,
You brought joy and love, and set my soul free.
Your wagging tail and playful eyes so bright,
Bringing sunshine to my day, banishing the night.

You were always there, through thick and thin,
A constant companion, never to abandon within.
Your loyalty unwavering, your love so true,
A bond that grew stronger, as the years went through.

In my heart you'll forever stay,
A memory of happiness, a joyful way.
Though you may be gone, your spirit lives on,
Forever in my heart, my dearest dog, my friend, my one.
