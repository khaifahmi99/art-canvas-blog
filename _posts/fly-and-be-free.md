title: Fly and Be Free
---

Soar through the sky, little one,
Without a care or a frown.
Your wings will carry you far,
To places where you'll never be scarred.

You don't need chains or cages,
To hold you back or make you stage.
Just spread your wings and take flight,
And let your spirit soar with all its might.

For in the sky, you're free indeed,
With no worries, just pure speed.
You can dance on the wind's breeze,
And sing a song of sweet ease.

So fly and be free, little one,
In the vast blue yonder, have fun.
