title: The Loneliness of the Moon
---

Oh, gentle moon, how you shine so bright in the night
A beacon of hope, a sight to behold, a beauty in sight
But do you ever feel lonely up there in the sky?
Does your glow ever dim, does your light ever die?

You dance among the stars, a graceful waltz in space
A solitary figure, lost in the cosmic race
Do you long for company, for someone to share in your fate?
Or do you find solace in the silence of the night's state?

Perhaps the loneliness is just an illusion, a myth to dispel
For you are never truly alone, for you have the universe to tell
But still, the thought lingers, a subtle thread in your mind
A reminder that even the brightest stars can find solace in kind.
