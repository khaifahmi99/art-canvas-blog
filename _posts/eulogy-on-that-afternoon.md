title: Eulogy on that Afternoon
---

In the heat of that summer day,
I remember the moment so well,
The way you smiled and brightened the way,
And in my heart, your love did dwell.

Your laughter echoed through the air,
As we sat beneath the willow's care,
And though I couldn't see your face so fair,
I knew your joy would be without compare.

That afternoon, so full of grace,
Was when our love found its place,
In the garden of my heart, you chose,
To bloom and flourish with endless joys.

Now as I sit alone and blue,
I miss that smile and laughter anew,
But in my memories, you'll always be,
A shining light that sets me free.
