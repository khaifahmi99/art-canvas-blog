title: The Schrödinger Cat
---

In a box, a cat so still,
Schrödinger's thought experiment, oh so thrilling.
A life in balance, suspended in time,
A tale of quantum strife and prime.

Inside the box, a particle resides,
A wave function collapses, or does it hide?
The cat is dead, or alive, we can't tell,
A paradox of physics, a tale to sell.

The observer effect takes hold,
Collapsing waves, a new story unfold.
Reality shifts, the future unfolds,
A tale of quantum magic, beyond gold.

Inside the box, a mystery resides,
A world of probabilities, where we hide.
Schrödinger's cat, a tale so grand,
A world of wonder, at our command.
