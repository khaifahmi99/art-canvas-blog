title: The Rain After the Long Draught
---

The rain after the long draught,
A sight to behold and a treat.
Nature's cleansing ritual, so neat.
Washing away the dust and the heat.

Gray skies weep tears of relief,
As the parched earth drinks deep and belief.
The smell of wet earth, so rich and true.
A symphony of sounds, an orchestra new.
Raindrops on leaves, a melody to hear.
A refreshing sight, banishing all fear.
