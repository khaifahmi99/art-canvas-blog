title: The Circle Road
---

On the circle road, I travel far
From the city's hustle to the countryside's star
The miles pass by, like a flowing stream
As I make my way to my dream

Through mountains high and valleys low
The landscape changes, but my heart glows
With hope and wonder in each new view
On this journey, I find myself anew

The circle road takes me where I want to go
To places unseen, and experiences yet to know
It winds and turns, like a serpent's path
Leading me to the unknown, but never too late

For on this journey, I am free to roam
With the wind in my hair, and the sun on my face, home
The circle road is my guide, my friend
As I travel on, until my journey's end.
