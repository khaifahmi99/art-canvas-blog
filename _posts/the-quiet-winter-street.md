Frosty winds howl through the night
As snowflakes dance with gentle might
The quiet winter street is blanketed in white
A peaceful sight, a serene delight

The trees stand tall, their limbs outstretched
Like sculpted sentinels guarding the place
Where silence reigns, and all is still
In this winter wonderland, so chill

The world is hushed, save for the crunch
Of boots on snow, a soft, gentle bunch
Of footsteps echoing through the night
As people navigate with care and light

The quiet winter street, so pure and bright
A place of peace, where all is right
