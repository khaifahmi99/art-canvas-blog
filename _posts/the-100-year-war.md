title: The 100 Year War
---

The battle raged on, a war without end
A century of strife, a legacy to mend
From the fields of France to the streets of London town
The clash of swords, a cacophony of woe

The armies clashed, their banners intertwined
As the years went by, the bloodshed unwind
The loss and grief, a toll on hearts and minds
A war that seemed to have no end in sight

But still they fought, through rain and snow
With courage high, their honor to show
For freedom's sake, for pride and for their land
They marched forth, with steadfast hand

The 100 Year War, a test of time and fate
A tale of heroes, a story to relate
Of sacrifice and honor, of lives laid down
In the name of victory, or so it's crown.
