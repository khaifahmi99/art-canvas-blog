title: Hopeless Without You
---

My heart is lost, my soul is gone
Without you, I am but a shell
Every moment without your embrace
Leaves me feeling hopeless and helpless

The memories of our love remain
A constant ache that never fades
I yearn for your touch, your gentle hand
To guide me through this endless shade

In your eyes, my heart finds solace
A refuge from the darkest night
With you by my side, I know I'm strong
Together we can face any plight

But without you, I am lost and alone
Adrift in a world that's cold and grey
My heart is heavy, my spirit weak
Yearning for your love to stay.
