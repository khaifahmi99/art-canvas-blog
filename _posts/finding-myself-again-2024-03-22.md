title: Finding Myself Again
---

I've been lost in my own mind,
Wandering through life without a guide.
Searching for the person I once was,
Before the world turned me inside out and upside down.

I've been trying to find myself again,
Peeling back the layers of pain and regret.
Uncovering the truth that lies beneath,
And learning to love myself, no matter the cost.

It's a journey I never thought I'd take,
But here I am, with my heart full of hope.
Finding myself again, one step at a time,
And learning to embrace who I truly am.
