title: The Queen of Babylon
---

In ancient times, she ruled with grace,
A monarch of renown and greatness in her place.
From the halls of Babylon, she held sway,
Her people flocked to hear her every day.

With beauty and charm, she won them over,
And they obeyed her every command and cover.
She wore a crown of gold and pearls so bright,
And in her eyes, a fire that shone like light.

The Queen of Babylon, a figure grand,
A symbol of power, in a land so bland.
Her legacy lives on, through the ages,
A testament to her greatness, in endless pages.
