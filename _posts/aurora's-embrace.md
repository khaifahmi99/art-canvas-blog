title: Aurora's Embrace
---

The sky awakens with colors so bright,
Aurora's embrace, a wondrous sight.
Red and green hues dance before me,
As the night gives way to morning's glee.

The northern lights perform their graceful show,
A kaleidoscope of color, as they go.
From fiery red to emerald green,
Each hue a unique and beautiful scene.

In this ethereal display of light,
I find solace from the dark of night.
The aurora's gentle touch, so fine,
Brings peace and tranquility to mine eyes.
