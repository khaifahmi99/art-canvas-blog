We set out on our quest anew
To fight the dragons, brave and true
With swords in hand and hearts of gold
Our journey's tale, let it be told

Through mountains high and valleys deep
We searched for those fierce creatures to keep
Our spirits strong, our will unbroken
For the fight ahead, we'd not be forgotten

With each step, the danger grew near
But fear did not our hearts despair
For with you by my side, my dear
Together we'd conquer, never to fear

The dragons roared, their flames ablaze
But we stood tall, our courage raised
Our shouts of triumph echoed through the land
As we fought for victory, hand in hand
