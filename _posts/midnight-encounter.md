title: Midnight Encounter
---

Under the velvet sky, so bright and wide,
Two souls entwined, their love did abide.
In the quiet hours, they shared a sigh,
As their hearts did beat in unison high.

Their eyes did lock, a tender gaze,
A connection strong, without a trace.
The stars up above, they twinkled with glee,
As this midnight encounter was meant to be.
