title: Meteor Shower on December Night
---

Twinkling lights in the winter sky,
A celestial show unfolds nigh.
December's meteor shower doth appear,
A magical sight beyond compare.

As shooting stars streak across the land,
The night air fills with a gentle hand.
The cosmos put on a show so bright,
A wondrous sight that takes flight.

So let us bask in the glow of the night,
And marvel at the stars' gentle might.
For in this moment, we are one with the sky,
And the universe's magic does not die.
