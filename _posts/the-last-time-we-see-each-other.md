title: The Last Time We See Each Other
---

We hug each other tight,
As tears fall from our eyes.
The last time we see each other,
In this life, before we say goodbye.

Memories of laughter and love,
Of times spent together in the night.
But now, it's time to move on,
To a place where there's no more fight.

We hold onto each other,
As the world around us fades away.
The last time we see each other,
In this life, before we go our separate ways.
