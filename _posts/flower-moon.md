title: Flower Moon
---

Under the flower moon, I stroll alone,
The petals dance, as my heart is shown,
To the beauty of nature's throne.
In this moment, I am home.

The sky is painted with colors bright,
As the moon smiles down with delight,
A time for love and joy to take flight.
In the flower moon's embrace, all is right.
