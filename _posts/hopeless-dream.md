title: Hopeless Dream
---

In a world that's full of strife,
A dream I hold onto with life.
A hope that never seems to fade,
A desire that's always at play.

A hopeless dream, some might say,
But for me, it's the only way.
To find solace in the night,
And chase away the dark of flight.

So I hold on tight and dear,
To this dream that brings me cheer.
For in its light, I find my way,
Through the darkness of each passing day.
