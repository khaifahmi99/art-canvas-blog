title: Disappointment and Treachery
---

In the depths of my soul, a fire burns bright
A flame of disappointment, that's been ignited tonight
The trust I placed in thee, has been broken and shattered
Left to pick up the pieces, of a love that's been scattered

Thy words were honey, thy smile was sweet
But behind the facade, thy heart was not complete
Thou didst deceive me, with lies so subtle and grand
And now I stand alone, in this desolate land

My heart is heavy, my spirit is weak
For I have been betrayed, by one I once sought to seek
The love we shared, has turned to dust and ashes
Leaving me with nothing, but the memories of what could've been

But still I hold on, to the hope in my heart
That someday, love will find its way back to us from the start
For though thou hast betrayed me, thy love I will never forget
And in time, perhaps we'll find our way back to what we once knew.
