title: When the Gladiator Lost Its Battle Axe
---

With mighty blows, the gladiator fought,
But lost its weapon in the heat of bout.
The battle axe, once a trusty friend,
Now lies defeated on the ground, its end.

The warrior's strength did not abate,
But without his weapon, he felt fate.
He fought with fury, but to no avail,
For his opponent was too strong and frail.

The crowd did cheer, but also mourn,
As the gladiator lost its battleborn.
The axe, once a symbol of might,
Now lies broken, in the morning light.
