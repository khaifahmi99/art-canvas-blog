title: The Final Breath
---

Fading away, my spirit flees,
A final breath, my body beseeches.
Earthly form, I bid thee adieu,
My soul ascends, to realms anew.

In the depths of death's darkest night,
I find solace in the light of sight.
Where love and peace their reign maintain,
And sorrows are but memories sustain.

Farewell, dear world, I leave thee now,
With memories of joys that once did crown.
Though parted from thy warm embrace,
My spirit soars, in endless space.
