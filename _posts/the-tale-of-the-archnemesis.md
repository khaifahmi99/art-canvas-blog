title: The Tale of the Archnemesis
---

In the shadows, they lurk and scheme,
A mastermind of mischief, a wicked dream.
Their power grows, as innocence falls,
And the world trembles at their archnemesis call.

With cunning and guile, they spread their reign,
And chaos ensues, like a stormy refrain.
Their foes are many, but they stand tall,
For they know the archnemesis will not enthrall.

In the end, it's a tale of good vs. evil,
A clash of titans, with the fate of the world to seal.
Will lightning strike, or will darkness reign?
Only time will tell, in this epic archnemesis refrain.
