title: The Cruel World
---

In a world that's cold and unforgiving,
Where love is just a fleeting feeling,
We find ourselves lost in the shadows,
With hearts that are forever breaking.

The cruel hands of fate have dealt us,
A hand we cannot hope to conceal,
And though we try to mend the cracks,
They only seem to spread and deepen.

In this world of endless hurt and pain,
We search for solace in vain,
But find ourselves drowning in a sea,
Of tears that never cease to rain.

So we cling to hope, a fragile thing,
And pray for a brighter dawn to bring,
A time when love will heal our scars,
And the cruel world will no longer mar.
