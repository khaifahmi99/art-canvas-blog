title: Reminiscing Tears and Efforts
---

Tears that fall like rain
Efforts that never end in vain
Memories of laughter and love
Haunting me from above

The pain of what could have been
Lingers like a heavy weight
On the heart that's filled with sin
A burden hard to relate

The memories of joy and cheer
Fading faster than they appear
Leaving only tears and fear
In this emptiness, I hear

The whispers of regret and shame
Echoing through my brain
Reminding me of what I've done
And all the love that's been undone
