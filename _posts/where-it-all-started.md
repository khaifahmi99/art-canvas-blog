title: Where It All Started
---

In days of old, when tales were told
And legends lived in every fold
Of mountains high, of seas so blue
Where stories came to life anew

From fields of green, where flowers bloomed
To forests deep, where creatures brooded
The memories lingered, fresh and true
Of days gone by, and all we knew

In that place, where it all started
Our journey began, our path uncharted
With dreams and hopes, with hearts ablaze
We set forth on a quest to amaze

And though the road was long and winding
Through trials fierce, through tests of kind
We held on tight, we never faltered
For in our hearts, our dreams were hallowed
