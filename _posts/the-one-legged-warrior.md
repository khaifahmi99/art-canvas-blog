title: The One-Legged Warrior
---

With one leg left behind, he fought on
Through fields of battle, where death was dawn
His determination, unbreakable will
Inspired comrades, and made them thrilled

He walked with a limp, but never fell
His spirit unbroken, his heart unwell
With every step, he proved his might
A true warrior, in the eyes of the light

His enemies trembled at his approach
For they knew he would not be caught
In their traps, or their snares
He fought on, with scars and cares

A hero in battle, a symbol of hope
For those who face challenges to cope
With strength and courage, he stood tall
The one-legged warrior, never to fall
