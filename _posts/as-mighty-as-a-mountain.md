title: As Mighty as a Mountain
---

I stood tall and proud, my peaks reaching for the sky
But the winds of change were strong, and they made me cry
I felt my strength begin to wane, my foundation shake
And in the end, I was left with nothing but a fake

My roots dug deep into the earth, my branches wide and strong
But the storms of life took their toll, and I couldn't hold on
I cracked and crumbled, my beauty gone
Leaving behind only memories of what once was
