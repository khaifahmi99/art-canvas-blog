title: Long Distance Breaks Us Apart
---

Our hearts once beating as one
Now stretched across the miles apart
The distance between us, a barrier undone
Leaving our love in tatters, torn and scarred

We used to talk for hours on end
But now our conversations dwindle and descend
Into whispers of what once was, a distant trend
As the miles between us, our love amends

We try to find solace in each other's embrace
But it's hard when we're living in different places
The distance makes us feel so out of place
And fills our hearts with a lonely, endless space

Long distance breaks us apart
Leaving us with just a shattered heart
But still, we hold on to the hope
That someday soon, we'll find our way back to each other's arms.
