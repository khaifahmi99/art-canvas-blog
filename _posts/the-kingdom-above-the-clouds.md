title: The Kingdom Above the Clouds
---

In a realm beyond the skies,
Where clouds are but a disguise,
Lies a kingdom of pure delight,
A place where dreams take flight.

With towers that touch the sky,
And halls that stretch on high,
The palace shines with golden light,
A beacon in the night.

In gardens full of life and grace,
The flowers bloom in endless space,
Their sweet perfume fills the air,
And love is everywhere.

The people here are kind and free,
Their laughter echoes wild and carefree,
In this enchanted land of joy,
Where laughter never grows old.
