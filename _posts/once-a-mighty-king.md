title: Once a Mighty King
---

Once a mighty king, with crown so bright
Ruled the land with grace and might
His word was law, his will a sight
To be obeyed by day and night

He stood tall and proud on his throne
With power that none could call their own
His legacy stretched far and wide
As he led his people to pride

But as time passed, his reign did fade
And the king's once-mighty rule was made
Into stories told by the fire's shade
Of a time when power was worth the try
