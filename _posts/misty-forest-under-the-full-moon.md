title: Misty Forest Under the Full Moon
---

In the misty forest, the full moon glows bright,
A beacon in the darkness, a guiding light.
The trees sway gently in the breeze,
As if they dance to the rhythm of the night's ease.

The forest floor is dappled with shade,
A place where creatures roam and glide with grace.
The moon casts a spell, a magic so true,
Transforming the scene into a dream anew.

So come and walk in this mystic land,
Where the full moon reigns supreme, hand in hand.
Let the forest's magic wash over you,
And let your spirit soar, as free as a dove true.
