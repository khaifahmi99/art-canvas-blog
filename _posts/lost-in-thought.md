title: Lost in Thought
---

In a world of confusion, I find myself lost in thought
A maze of emotions, where feelings are brought to life
The mind races on, a whirlwind of questions and doubts
As I search for answers, my soul is left adrift

The past lingers, like shadows on the wall
Memories of joy and sorrow, that never seem to fall
The present moment fades, like sand between my fingers
Leaving me with nothing but the future's uncertain clutches

In this vast expanse, I wander alone
A stranger in a world that's always changing tone
I search for solace, a beacon in the night
But find only emptiness, and the endless fight

To find my way, to make sense of it all
To discover the truth, and rise above the fall
For in these depths of thought, I find my strength
A power that grows with each breath, a light that never ceases.
