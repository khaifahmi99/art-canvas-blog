title: Never Dies
---

In the depths of darkness, I find my strength
A flame that flickers, never to cease
Hope, a beacon in the endless night
Guiding me on, with all its might

Through trials and tribulations, I persist
Aspirations burning, never to rest
The fire within, a driving force
Driving me forward, with endless course

Never dies as long as there is hope
A constant reminder, to never give up the rope
In the face of adversity, it shines so bright
A guiding light, in the darkest night
