The midnight sun, oh how it glows
A sight to behold, in the northern lands below
Where the night is bright, and the stars shine so bold
In this place where the magic of nature is told

The sky is alive with colors, a kaleidoscope of hues
As the sun hangs low, and the shadows dance anew
The world is bathed in a gentle light, without any fright
In this realm of wonder, where all is bright and right

So let us marvel at this sight, this wondrous display
Of nature's splendor, that never fades away
For in the midnight sun, we find a beauty so rare
A reminder of the magic, that's always there.
