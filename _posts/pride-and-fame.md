With every step I take, I feel my worth
Above the rest, my spirit soars
I chase my dreams, with eyes on fire
For in my heart, a burning desire

To make my mark, to leave a trace
To stand apart, and show my face
In halls of fame, where names are written
I'll carve my path, and make it shine bright

My ambition knows no bounds or fears
It drives me on, through laughter and tears
For I know that with each step I take
I draw closer to the prize I seek
And when I reach it, I'll make my claim
To pride and fame, my heart's sweet aim
