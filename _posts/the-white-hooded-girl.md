In the heart of the forest, where trees stretch high and wide,
Lives a girl with a hood, her face hidden inside.
Her eyes, like the night sky, shine bright and deep,
A mystery to behold, in this lonely retreat.

She roams the woods, with graceful steps so light,
As if she's one with nature, in sight.
Her footprints disappear, without a trace,
Leaving behind an aura of peace and space.

The wind whispers secrets, as it dances through the trees,
And the girl listens closely, with her ear to the breeze.
She hears the stories, of the forest's past,
And the magic that dwells, within its vastness at last.

Her hood keeps her safe, from the world outside,
A refuge for solitude, where she can reside.
In this peaceful place, she finds her true self,
A soulmate to nature, in perfect health.
