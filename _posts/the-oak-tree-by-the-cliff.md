title: The Oak Tree by the Cliff
---

A towering giant stands by the edge,
The oak tree's might, a sight to behold.
Its branches stretch towards the sky so bold,
A home for birds, a haven to unfold.

The cliff below, a steep descent,
A reminder of nature's infinite extent.
The tree's roots dig deep into the earth,
A testament to life's enduring worth.

The breeze whispers secrets in its leaves,
A language known only to the trees.
It speaks of seasons past and future too,
A tale of nature, wild and true.
