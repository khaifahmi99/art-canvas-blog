title: The Temple of Dragons
---

In a realm of fire and smoke,
Where dragons reign supreme,
There stands a temple grand,
A place of power, a place to dream.

With walls of gold and stones so bright,
It glimmers in the sun's light,
A beacon calling all to come,
And bask in its radiance anew.

Inside, the dragons reside,
Their roars echoing far and wide,
Their scales shining with a grace so true,
As they guard this sacred place anew.

The temple's power is great and strong,
It calls to those who come along,
To feel its magic, to bask in the light,
And let their spirits take flight.
