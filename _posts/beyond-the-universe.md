title: Beyond the Universe
---

In the vast expanse of space and time,
Lies a realm beyond the universe's confine.
A place where stars and planets are but a dream,
And the laws of physics no longer gleam.

Where darkness reigns supreme, yet light does shine,
A realm of pure potentiality divine.
Where the cosmos stretch and bend in time,
And the infinite possibilities entwine.

In this realm, the laws of causality are naught,
Where free will reigns and choices are sought.
The fabric of reality is rent asunder,
And the threads of fate are forever slender.

Here, the universe is but a speck,
A tiny part of something much more distinct.
A world beyond our own, untold and unseen,
Where the secrets of creation are revealed in sheen.
