title: A Midsummer Night's Dream
---

In the forest, where lovers dance and play,
Amidst the trees, a dream takes flight.
The moon shines bright, casting spells all night,
As Oberon, Titania, and Puck take flight.

With magic wings, they soar on high,
And the world below, they pass by.
They dance with fairies, and laugh with glee,
In this enchanted land, they are free.

But as the night wears on, and the sun begins to rise,
The dream begins to fade, and the lovers' eyes close.
For in the morning light, the magic dissipates,
And the world awakens, to a new day's embrace.
