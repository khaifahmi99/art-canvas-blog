title: Dream Thief
---

In the dead of night, a shadow creeps,
Stealing dreams from sleeping souls.
With eyes that glow like embers bright,
He weaves a tapestry of endless night.

His form is twisted, dark and grim,
A creature born from nightmares' whim.
He whispers tales of fear and pain,
And drains the dreams away like rain.

But some resist his wicked spell,
Their dreams remain, unbroken, unswelled.
For in the darkness, they find strength,
A light that shines against the night's length.

So sleep tight, and dream of peace,
For though the thief may steal with ease,
Your spirit will not be broken or tamed,
For dreams are what your soul has gained.
