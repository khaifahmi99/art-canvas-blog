title: Unimaginable Betrayal
---

Betrayal cuts deep, like a knife in the night
Leaving scars that never quite heal right
A breach of trust, a shattered dream
A heart left broken, a soul in shame

Lies and deceit, they sting like a bee
Leaving us lost, alone, and free
To wonder how we could have been so blind
To the unimaginable betrayal that we find

But still we rise, with hearts full of fire
Determined to survive, to never retire
From the ashes of betrayal, we'll emerge anew
With strength and resilience, our spirits true.
