The weight of loss is heavy on my heart,
A burden I can't seem to shake off.
Memories of you linger, a constant start,
A reminder of what could have been, but alas, off.

Days blend together like a hazy dream,
As I try to find my way through the pain.
I thought time would heal, make things seem,
But the ache remains, like a scar that's gained.

I long to move on, leave the past behind,
But it follows me, like a shadow of grief.
The memories of you still linger in my mind,
A bittersweet reminder of what could have been.

But I'll learn to let go, to find my way,
To move on and live life each passing day.
For though you're gone, your memory stays,
A reminder that love never truly fades away.
