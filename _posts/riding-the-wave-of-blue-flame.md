title: Riding the Wave of Blue Flame
---

Riding the wave of blue flame,
Passion burning bright and warm.
A force that's wild and free,
Carrying me to places unknown.

With every beat of my heart,
The fire grows, a work of art.
A symphony of sparks and heat,
Dancing in the light of my dreams.

I ride the wave of blue flame,
Lost in the heat of the game.
A game of passion and fire,
Where love is the prize I desire.

So let the flames rise high,
And consume me completely.
For in their embrace, I find my home,
Riding the wave of blue flame, I am free to roam.
