title: War and Sanity
---

In the midst of war's chaotic fray,
Sanity's fragile thread begins to stray.
The cacophony of guns and screams,
Erodes the mind's serene reprieve.

Like a ship lost at sea,
Fragments of hope are all we see.
The horizon, once so bright,
Now shrouded in an endless night.

In this maelstrom of despair,
Sanity struggles to stay unfair.
The weight of grief and loss,
Bears down with crushing force.

But still we hold on tight,
To the tenuous thread of light.
For in the face of madness,
Hope is all that's left to cling to tight.
