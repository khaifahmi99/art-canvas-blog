title: Who's Gonna Love You Like Me?
---

I'll be there to love you, through and through
With every beat of my heart, I'll love you true
In good times and bad, I'll be by your side
Who's gonna love you like me, when the stars shine bright?

I'll be your shelter in the rain
Your safe haven, where you can remain
I'll be your rock, your guiding light
Who's gonna love you like me, with all of my might?

In your eyes, I see a spark
A love so bright, it leaves me spellbound and scarred
With every kiss, my heart takes flight
Who's gonna love you like me, through the night?
