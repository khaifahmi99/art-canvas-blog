title: Massacre's Shadow
---

In the shadow of a massacre, I find peace
A fleeting moment, a fragile release
From the horrors that lay within my chest
A weight so heavy, it seemed to never rest

The screams of the dead still echo in my ears
Their cries of pain and fear, forever near
I see their faces, twisted in agony
Their eyes, filled with a plea for mercy

But amidst the chaos, I find solace too
A glimmer of hope, a ray of blue
In the darkness that surrounds me, I find light
A beacon of peace, to guide me through the night

So I hold on tight, to this fragile peace
And pray it will last, until release
For in the midst of war and strife
I find solace in the gentle life
