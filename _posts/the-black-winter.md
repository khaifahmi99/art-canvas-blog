title: The Black Winter
---

The black winter winds howl through the trees,
A chilling melody that freezes all it sees.
The sky is gray and bleak, without a smile,
As if the sun had hidden for goodbye.

The ground is blanketed in snow and ice,
A frozen landscape where life cannot thrive.
The trees stand bare, their limbs outstretched,
Like skeletons left to wither and decay.

But in this darkness, there's beauty too,
A time for rest, a time for renewal true.
So let the winter winds howl and roar,
For in their song, I hear a promise more.
