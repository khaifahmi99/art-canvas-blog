title: The Tower of Babel
---

In the land of confusion, where tongues entwine,
The people spoke in huddles, each one a shrine.
Their voices rose in chorus, a cacophony divine,
As they built the tower to reach the heavens' shine.

With bricks of words and mortar of intent,
They climbed the mountainside, their spirits bent.
But as they reached for the sky so high and bright,
Their languages began to split, a bitter fight.

"Let us build this tower," each group would say,
"And make it reach the heavens' own way."
But as they spoke, their words did stray,
Into a maze of tongues that made no stay.

The people shouted, their voices in dismay,
As the tower grew taller, but lost its way.
And though they climbed so high and so far,
Their languages were lost, beyond repair.

Now the tower stands, a monument to strife,
A reminder of language's great life.
For though it fell, its legacy thrives,
In the diversity of tongues that survives.
