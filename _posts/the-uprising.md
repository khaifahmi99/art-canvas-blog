title: The Uprising
---

Rebellion brews within the soul,
A fire that burns, a flame that's whole.
The voices of dissent rise high,
As the oppressed stand up to sky.

Chains of oppression break apart,
As freedom takes its place in the heart.
The uprising is a force so bold,
A beacon shining bright and cold.

Through struggles and strife we'll find our way,
To a world where all can live each day.
For justice and equality we'll strive,
Until the dawn of a new life.
