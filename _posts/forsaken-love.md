title: Forsaken Love
---

My heart was once filled with love,
But now it's left to droop and shove.
The one I thought would be my own,
Has forsaken me, alone and thrown.

The memories of our laughter and cheer,
Now haunt me, night and year.
The tears I've cried, the fears I've faced,
Have left my heart in a lonely space.

I long to hold you close once more,
To feel your touch and love's sweet score.
But alas, it seems you're out of sight,
Leaving me in this desolate plight.
