title: Four Shades of Maroon
---

Maroon, a rich and deep hue,
A color that's both bold and true.
From light to dark, there are four shades,
Each one unique, with its own parade.

The first is light, almost pink,
A gentle hue that's easy to link.
It brings to mind romance and love,
A color that's sweet from above.

The second shade is dark and deep,
A bold and fierce hue to keep.
It's the color of passion and fire,
A shade that's sure to inspire.

The third is a midnight blue,
A dark and mysterious hue anew.
It's the color of the night's embrace,
A shade that brings us to a place.

The fourth and final shade is red,
A bold and vibrant hue, indeed.
It's the color of energy and life,
A shade that brings us joy and strife.

Maroon, a color that's both grand,
A palette that's diverse and bland.
From light to dark, there are four shades,
Each one unique, with its own parade.
