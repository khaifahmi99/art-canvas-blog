title: Swallowing the Darkness
---

In the depths of night, I dive
Into the shadows, where I thrive
Amidst the darkness, I find my voice
A whispered hymn to the soul's rejoice

The stars above, they twinkle bright
As I dance within the endless night
My heart beats fast, with a gentle might
As I embrace the mystery of the light

In this realm of shadows and night
I find solace in the darkness of sight
For in its depths, I see the truth
That darkness is where my soul finds proof

So I'll swallow the darkness whole
And let it fill my heart and soul
For in its embrace, I find my peace
A tranquility that never ceases.
