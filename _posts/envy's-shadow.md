title: Envy's Shadow
---

In the depths of my soul, where shadows roam,
I feel the weight of envy's darkest gloom.
A friendship lost, a scar that will not heal,
For the green-eyed monster has its evil deal.

Envy crept in, like a thief in the night,
Stealing joy and love with its malignant might.
It whispered lies, and fueled my fears,
Till I lost the one who was dear to me for years.

Now I wander alone, with a heart so sore,
Wishing I could turn back time and close that door.
But alas, fate's cruel hand has dealt its blow,
Leaving me to grieve and wonder why and how.

Envy may hide behind a mask of pride,
But its ugliness will forever reside.
In the end, it's the jealous one who will pay,
For true friendship knows no room for envy's sway.
