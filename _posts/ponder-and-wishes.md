title: Ponder and Wishes
---

Wishes soar on wings of hope,
As I ponder life's grand scope.
For what I wish, for what I seek,
Is to find peace in this world so meek.

May my dreams be filled with light,
And guide me through the darkest night.
May my heart be pure and true,
And lead me to where I want to go.

In the depths of my soul's desire,
I find the strength to keep on fire.
For in the end, it is not gold,
But love that makes life worth living, bold.
