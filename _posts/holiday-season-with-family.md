title: Holiday Season with Family
---

Gather round the table, close to heart and home
Family gathered, laughter never alone
Togetherness in the air, a feeling so divine
Holiday season with loved ones, all the time

Memories made, traditions born anew
Sharing stories, secrets, and dreams true blue
Savor each moment, let joy fill the space
Holiday season with family, a treasure to embrace

From breakfast to bedtime, we share and we play
Giving thanks for each other, night and day
Gratitude in our hearts, love in every way
Holiday season with family, a time to cherish each day
