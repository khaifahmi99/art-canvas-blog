title: Two Dreams, One Gone
---

In the depths of my soul, two dreams reside,
One shining bright, the other inside.
The first, a beacon of hope and light,
Guiding me through life's darkest night.

The second, shrouded in mist and fog,
Haunts me with secrets yet untold.
It whispers sweet nothings in my ear,
Promising joy that I cannot hear.

But alas, the first dream has fled,
Leaving me lost in this wilderness instead.
I search for it, but it's gone for good,
And now the second dream is all I have to prove.

That it may bring me solace and peace,
But it taunts me with its elusive release.
I yearn to hold onto it tight,
But it slips through my fingers like a wisp of light.

So I cling to the second dream,
The only one that's left to beam.
And though it may not bring me back,
To the first, the one that was lost in the attack,
It offers solace and hope anew,
A dream that's still mine to pursue.
