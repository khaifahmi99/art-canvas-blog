title: Childhood Memories at the Dairy Farm
---

In the rolling hills of green,
Where cows roam with grace unseen,
I spent my childhood days,
At the dairy farm in endless praise.

The smell of fresh milk and hay,
Fills the air with joyous sway,
As I watched the farmers play,
With the animals night and day.

The sound of mooing echoes near,
As I clutch my pail with cheer,
Collecting cream for my dear old mother,
In this idyllic dairy brother.

Memories of laughter and delight,
Bring warmth to my heart tonight,
Of days spent at the dairy farm,
Where love and joy did disarm.
