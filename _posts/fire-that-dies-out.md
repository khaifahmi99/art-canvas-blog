title: Fire that Dies Out
---

Flames that once illuminated the night
Have flickered and died with a final goodbye
Embers glowing red, then gray, then none
Leaving only memories of what was once done

The fire that once brought warmth and light
Is now nothing but a distant sight
A fleeting moment in time's embrace
As memories fade like the morning's grace

We mourn the loss of something dear
A spark that lit the darkness for years
Yet in its passing, we find peace
In the knowledge that it will always release

The flames may have died out, but the fire remains
A symbol of hope in a world of pain
A reminder of love and joy within
A beacon to guide us through life's grief and sin
