title: Child's Wonderland
---

In a world of wonder, where dreams come true,
A child's mind is free, to imagine anew.
With eyes wide open, and heart full of cheer,
They dance with fairies, and laugh without fear.

Their imagination runs wild and free,
As they chase after dragons, in a fantasy land see.
With every step, their spirit takes flight,
In a world where magic is alive tonight.

So let them dream, let them play,
For in their imaginations, they'll find their way.
To a place of wonder, where happiness resides,
In the hearts of children, with an endless supply of pride.
