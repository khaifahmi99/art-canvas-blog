title: The Ruins of Atlantis
---

In the depths of the ocean, where the light is low
Lies the remnants of a city, once a place to know
Atlantis, the realm of the gods, now but a memory
A place of wonder, where myth and legend beckon thee

The temples stand tall, though crumbling with time
Their grandeur still visible, in this underwater rhyme
The ruins of Atlantis, a testament to the past
A civilization lost, forever to last

In the depths of the sea, where the treasures lie
Lies the secrets of Atlantis, waiting to be tried
The stories of old, of a people long gone
Speak of a city, where the gods once were known

Their magic and might, now but a distant dream
As the ruins of Atlantis, forever it seems
A place of wonder, where myth and legend roam
The lost civilization, in the depths of the sea's home.
