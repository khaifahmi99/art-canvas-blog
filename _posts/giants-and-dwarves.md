title: Giants and Dwarves
---

In a world where sizes matter,
Where giants roam and dwarves flatter,
A tale of adventure, of bravery unfurled.

With the might of mountains at their side,
Giants stride across the land with pride,
Their roars echoing through the valleys wide.

Dwarves huddle in their underground abode,
Their craftsmanship and skill unmatched, they know,
Their gems and jewels shining bright as gold.

Together they journey, hand in hand,
Against the darkness that doth stand,
To bring light to the lands of old.
