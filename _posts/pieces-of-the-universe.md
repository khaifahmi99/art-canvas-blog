title: Pieces of the Universe
---

In the vast expanse of the night sky,
A tapestry woven with stars on high,
The pieces of the universe, so bright and nigh,
Paint a picture of beauty in sight.

From the sun's golden hue to the moon's gentle glow,
Each fragment of the cosmos below,
Comes together in a celestial show,
A dance of light that our eyes can know.

The stars and planets spin with graceful ease,
As if by some divine cosmic breeze,
In perfect harmony they move with precision,
A symphony of light that's pure devotion.

So let us marvel at this celestial sight,
And bask in the beauty of the universe's delight,
For in its infinite vastness and divine light,
We find solace and wonder in the night's delights.
