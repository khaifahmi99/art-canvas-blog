title: An Army of Broken Hearts
---

An army of broken hearts, marching on the ground
The weight of sorrow, crushing them down
Tears streaming like a river, never-ending stream
Aching hearts, longing for sweet dreams

The wounds they bear, scars that won't heal
Emptiness within, a soul's reveal
Love lost, memories fade away
An army of broken hearts, every day

Their footsteps echo, through corridors of time
Echoes of love, forever intertwined
A melody of pain, a symphony of strife
An army of broken hearts, a life.
