title: Drugs that Keep Me Going
---

I chase the dragon with each dose,
The high I feel, it never loses.
A jolt of energy, a rush of cheer,
My body's fuel, my mind's clear.

With every swallow, I feel alive,
My senses sharp, my spirit thrive.
I tackle tasks, both big and small,
My productivity, it stands tall.

The world spins fast, the pace is keen,
But with these drugs, I'm always seen.
I keep on moving, never slow,
With energy to spare, I go.
