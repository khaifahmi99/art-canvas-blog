In the silence of night, I hear your voice so clear,
My dear daughter, gone from me, my heart is torn apart,
Cancer took you, my sweet angel, and tore us apart.

I remember the day you were born, a ray of light,
A precious gift from God, sent to bring joy and delight.
You grew up in my arms, a shining star, so bright,
A blessing from above, a treasure to hold tight.

But then the monster came, with evil intent,
Cancer took you away, and made me feel bent.
I watched you suffer, I saw your pain,
I held you close, but could not keep you from the train.

Your smile was my sunshine, my guiding light,
You brought hope to those around, with your gentle might.
But now you're gone, and I am left alone,
To mourn the loss of my dear one, and to face this sorrow of mine.

I wish I could turn back time, to save you from harm,
But life had other plans, and now you're in God's arms.
I'll cherish every memory, of the time we had,
And hold them close to my heart, where they will forever be made.

My dear daughter, I'll see you again someday,
In a place where love never fades away.
Until then, rest in peace, my sweet child,
Momma loves you still, and always will.
