title: The Rose Song
---

A gentle breeze stirs the air,
As I ponder on my heart's repair,
With thoughts of love and sweet delight,
I find solace in this rose so bright.

Her petals soft as silk to touch,
Her scent a mix of earthy clutch,
She symbolizes beauty untold,
A true marvel of nature whole.

In her presence, I find my peace,
My worries fade like autumn's release,
For in her eyes, I see a glow,
A radiance that only love can know.
