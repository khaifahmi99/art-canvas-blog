title: Fluffy Pink Clouds
---

Across the sky, a soft and gentle sight
Fluffy pink clouds drift with graceful flight
Their delicate forms dance in the breeze
A breathtaking view that brings us to our knees

So let us marvel at this natural beauty
And let our spirits soar with the clouds' gleeful duty
For in their fleeting grace, we find a peace
That only nature's art can release.
