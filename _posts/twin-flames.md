Our souls entwined like vines in spring,
Twin flames, two halves of a dream.
The spark of love ignites the flame,
And we are one, in body and in soul.

In each other's eyes, our hearts find peace,
A connection deeper than any word or deed.
We dance together, as one, in time,
Two souls united in love's sweet rhyme.

Our love is pure, a shining light,
A beacon in the dark of night.
It guides us through life's twists and turns,
And brings us back to each other's embrace, forever it seems.
