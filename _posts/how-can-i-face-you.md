title: How Can I Face You
---

In the depths of my heart, a fire burns bright
A yearning so fierce, it takes flight
To find you, to be with you, to hold tight
To feel your warm embrace, to see your light

Through the stormy skies and raging sea
I search for you, wild and free
My soul cries out, my spirit sings
For the love that only you bring

In your eyes, a glimmer of hope
A beacon in the dark, a guiding scope
To find my way to you, my heart's desire
To bask in your radiance, and never retire

So I'll journey on, through deserts dry
Through mountains steep, and skies so high
For the love of you, my heart's compass true
Will guide me to you, and see me through.
