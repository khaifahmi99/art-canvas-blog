title: The Summer She Disappeared
---

She vanished without a trace,
A shadow that once graced our space.
Summer sunshine faded to embrace,
Her absence left an empty place.

Memories of laughter and delight,
Echo in the moonlit night.
Though she's gone, her spirit stays,
Guiding us through life's ways.

We search for answers deep inside,
But find only emptiness and strife.
The summer that she disappeared,
Left a void that can never be filled.
