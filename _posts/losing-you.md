title: Losing You
---

My heart races as I think of you,
A warmth that once was, now lost in the blue.
Memories of laughter and tears we shared,
A love that was pure, but now it's hard to bear.

I try to move on, but your memory stays,
A constant reminder of what could have been.
I wish I could turn back time and make it right,
But life has other plans, and it's not always bright.

Losing you was like a punch in the dark,
Leaving me with a soul that's torn apart.
I thought our love would last, but it was not to be,
Now I'm left with just memories of thee.
