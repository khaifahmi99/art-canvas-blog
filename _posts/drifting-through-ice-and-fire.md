title: Drifting through ice and fire
---

In a world of wonder, I wander free
Through realms of ice and flames that dance with glee
With magic's grace, I soar on wings unseen
Through lands of fire and ice, where myths are spun

The Northern Lights flicker bright and bold
As dragons roam the skies, their tales untold
In forests deep, where ancient trees reside
Wise elves and dwarves, with secrets to abide

With every step, a tale unfolds
Of adventures brave, of magic's holds
Through mountains high and valleys low
I drift upon this journey, as the story grows.
