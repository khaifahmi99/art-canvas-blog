title: The Fire Emblem
---

The flames flicker bright, a beacon in the night
A symbol of hope, a symbol of light
Emblazoned on armor, a mark of pride
A fire emblem, burning deep inside

The heat it holds, a fierce delight
Blazing trails, where heroes take flight
Through trials and strife, it stands tall and true
A shining beacon, for all to view

For those who wield it, know the power
To vanquish foes, and bring them to flower
The fire emblem, a symbol of might
A badge of courage, in the heat of fight

So let the flames rise, and let the embers glow
For in the fire emblem, we find our flow
