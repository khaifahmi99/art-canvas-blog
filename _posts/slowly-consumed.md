title: Slowly Consumed
---

Winding its way up the wall,
The ivy's grip is so small,
Yet slow and steady it creeps,
Consuming all it sees.

Its tendrils wrap around the stone,
A prison of green and grey,
Growing stronger with each day,
Until there's nothing left to say.

The ivy's power is quite plain,
As it slowly consumes the space,
Around it, life will be sustained,
But at what cost, we cannot prune.
