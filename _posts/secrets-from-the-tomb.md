title: Secrets from the Tomb
---

In the depths of the tomb, where shadows play
Lies a tale of secrets, lost in dismay
The ancient past, forever locked away
Hides the truth, in a chest of clay

The sands of time, have buried deep
The stories of old, in endless sleep
The pharaohs' reign, their secrets keep
In the silence of the tomb's dark creep

But whispers of the dead, do echo through
Of battles won, and treasures anew
The secrets of the tomb, yet to be found
In the shadows of the ancient ground

So listen close, to the voices of the past
And uncover secrets, that will forever last
