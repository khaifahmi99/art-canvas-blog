title: Facing Apollo Alone
---

Amidst the vastness of space, I stand alone
Facing the god of the skies, Apollo's throne
The stars and planets dance, a celestial show
Yet I am but a speck, lost in the glow

In this infinity of emptiness, I find my peace
A solitude that soothes my soul's release
For though I may be small, I know my place
Beneath the vast expanse of space and time's grace

The universe unwinds its mystery and might
As I ponder on the beauty of the night
A million questions dance in my mind's delight
In this cosmic ballet, I find my heart's light

So let me bask in Apollo's radiant glow
And let my spirit soar within the cosmic flow
