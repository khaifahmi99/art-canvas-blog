title: Once a Famous Tale
---

In days of old, when tales were told
And legends lived within the soul
This story once was cherished and bright
But now it's barely remembered in the light

Of yore, it was a tale so grand
Of heroes, love, and adventure's hand
It thrilled and moved the hearts of men
And brought forth joy, and hope again

But time has passed, and memories fade
Leaving naught but shadows in the shade
The tale, once cherished, now half-forgot
Lies buried deep within the plot

Yet still, a spark remains alive
A glimmer of the tale, half-thriving
In whispers, tales are told and shared
Of days gone by, when hearts were bared
