title: My Love, Gloria
---

Her eyes are like the ocean deep,
A place where I could drown and sleep.
Her smile, a ray of sunshine bright,
Bringing light to my darkest night.

Gloria, my love, you shine so true,
A beacon in the darkness, guiding me anew.
With every breath, my heart doth sing,
For you are the melody that makes everything.
