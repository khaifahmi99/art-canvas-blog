title: From Pupae to Butterfly
---

In the cocoon, I resided,
A tiny creature, within a nest.
My wings, they slowly unfolded,
As my body changed, and new life was told.

From pupae to butterfly, I emerged,
With colors bright, and wings so fervent.
I danced in air, with graceful flight,
A beauty to behold, a wondrous sight.

My journey's end, a new beginning,
As I spread my wings, and take to the skies.
Free at last, from my cocooned fate,
I soar on winds, with a smile and great mate.
