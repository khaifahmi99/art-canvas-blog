title: This is me trying
---

I stand before the mirror, face unsmiling
A reflection of myself, so plain and unglamorous
But in these eyes, a world of emotions reside
A soul that's yearning to break free from its cage

I search for answers, but they evade my grasp
Like a mirage on the horizon, they fade away
The questions multiply, like a never-ending quiz
Will I ever find the truth, or will it always elude me?

I'm lost in this sea of uncertainty
Sinking deeper with each passing day
But still, I hold on to hope and its gentle sway
For in the depths below, a light may guide my way
